## 📌 Project Goal

- What problem are you addressing?
- What insights are you trying to generate?
- What decisions could be informed by your results?

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- *Python* 
- *NumPy* – numerical operations
- *Pandas* – data cleaning/manipulation
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – visualizations
- List other dependencies or environment files (e.g., requirements.txt, environment.yml).:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## ✨ Features

- Automatic data cleaning steps: handling missing values, type conversions, renaming columns, feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis including:
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std) via NumPy and Pandas
  - Histograms + KDE, boxplots, scatterplots, correlation heatmaps
- Optional: time‑series or group‑based visualizations

---

## 🧼 Data Source & Processing

- *Dataset origin*: Describe the data source, URL, license, or citation.
- *Columns description*: List major columns with meaning/types.
- *Cleaning steps*: e.g., "Removed columns with >30% missing, imputed median for numeric fields, coerced dates, standardized names".:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
